#RandomForest Classification REST API with Flask

This Flask application hosts a REST API for a RandomForest classification model. It allows users to make predictions by sending POST requests with data containing four features: 'Amount' (int), 'Refund' (float), 'Is_male' (bool), and 'Days_since_incident' (int).
Purpose

The primary purpose of this app is to provide a simple interface to utilize a pre-trained RandomForest classification model for making predictions based on specific input features.
How to Launch and Host the App
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed
    Flask library installed (pip install Flask)
    Trained RandomForest classification model saved as a pickle file

##Steps to Launch

    Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd app-flask-restapi-classifier
```

##Place the Trained Model

    Save your pre-trained RandomForest model as a .pkl file in the project directory.

##Run the Flask App

    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
    Run the Python script app.py:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

##API Endpoint

    The Flask app will start a local server.
    Access the API endpoint for predictions at:

```arduino

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict

    Send POST requests to this endpoint with JSON data containing the required features to get predictions from the RandomForest model.
```

##Making Predictions

    Send POST requests to the /predict endpoint with JSON data containing the following features:
        'Amount' (int)
        'Refund' (float)
        'Is_male' (bool)
        'Days_since_incident' (int)

##Example JSON Data for Prediction

```json
{
    "Amount": 500,
    "Refund": 20.5,
    "Is_male": true,
    "Days_since_incident": 30
}
```

##Expected Responses

    Successful Prediction:

```json
{
    "prediction": "<predicted_value>"
}
```

Error Handling:

```json
{
    "error": "Description of the encountered error"
}
